Steps:
1) Play Dota -> Create Lobby
2) Move yourself to a Coaching position on either team
3) Edit Lobby Settings (bottom right) and set RADIANT and DIRE BOTS to "LOCAL DEV SCRIPT", ALSO make sure BOT DIFFICULTY is anything but NONE
4) Paste your hero_selection.lua files into right location (for me on Windows 10 x64 it is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\bots) the naming is important (you will have to create a folder named "bots", don't call it "myBots" or some stuff like that.
